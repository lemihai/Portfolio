        "title": "Solution",
        "text": "To tackle ths challenge I conducted a two phased research with the first part being focused on an explorative approach on the usage of AI in research. The 2nd phase was focused on an experiment that explored levels of empathy in UX researchers that used AI tools compared to traditional methods."

        "text": "The first step in my research project was to explore the existing literature on the subject. To organize the pool of articles, podcasts, research papers, I created a system where I would select the most interesting materials and summarize them and  use them as references or inspiration. I chose to conduct desk research because itâ€™s important to explore the existing literature before starting a complex project. First of all to identify leads, then to understand what was already in the field."

Thus my goal for the desk research :",

The technique gives me the freedom also to ask follow-up questions and have a free conversation by deviating from the main protocol in case I find something interesting in the interview. I will also look for missing pieces in the practice like where AI can be used further and where it's not already used. Also, by listening to the needs of the researchers and getting more insights about their desires, wants and pain points, I can find out what can AI solve in the empathizing process."

Here, I am reading through the outputs of the AI tools used by the participants gathered in RM2 and RM3 and analyzing the data. At the end of each of the research methods, I asked people if they were willing to share information with me and whoever felt comfortable doing so, they did. Some people shared GPT conversations, some people shared images generated, poems, heatmaps, entire analysis processes, and multiple other things. "

Moreover, I proceeded to create data cards for each of the interviews. For RM3 (survey) I analyzed the results and validated them with the coding results of RM2. Moreover, I also drew a conclusion based on the answers of the participants. For RM4 (Uses of AI Analysis) I read the GPt conversations and I looked through the questions they were asking and the answers. I proceeded to validate the RM2 results with RM4.",
        "text-b": "I chose the method of coding interviews and analyzing the codes because this gave me a higher chance to identify patterns than if I did data cards, as the already created data cards are high in number and clustering and trying to identify patterns would have taken too much time.",

Moreover, I analyzed the interviews and watched the recordings to gather data on body language and the data gathered from participants. These observations were noted in a separate section from the data cards from the interviews. On the other hand, I read the GPT conversations and took out data cards from them to answer the questions from the protocol and further follow-up questions. "
