This reveals underlying values, interests, assumptions and world views. By reflecting on the use of technology in professional practice and daily life, the research group creates awareness of the impact of technology on people, professions and society as a whole, including the associated ethical dilemmas."

The 2nd phase was focused on an experiment that explored levels of empathy in UX researchers that used AI tools compared to traditional methods. I also created a concept AI tool that focuses on personas. "

To organize the pool of articles, podcasts, research papers, I created a system where I would select the most interesting materials and summarize them and  use them as references or inspiration.

First of all to identify leads, then to understand what was already in the field."

The technique gives me the freedom also to ask follow-up questions and have a free conversation by deviating from the main protocol in case I find something interesting in the interview. I will also look for missing pieces in the practice like where AI can be used further and where it's not already used. Also, by listening to the needs of the researchers and getting more insights about their desires, wants and pain points, I can find out what can AI solve in the empathizing process."

At the end of each of the research methods, I asked people if they were willing to share information with me and whoever felt comfortable doing so, they did. Some people shared GPT conversations, some people shared images generated, poems, heatmaps, entire analysis processes, and multiple other things. "
