        "text": "The Philosophy and Professional Practice research group analyses new technologies and the design practices and society trends that emerge from them. This reveals underlying values, interests, assumptions and world views. By reflecting on the use of technology in professional practice and daily life, the research group creates awareness of the impact of technology on people, professions and society as a whole, including the associated ethical dilemmas."

To organize the pool of articles, podcasts, research papers, I created a system where I would select the most interesting materials and summarize them and  use them as references or inspiration. I chose to conduct desk research because itâ€™s important to explore the existing literature before starting a complex project. First of all to identify leads, then to understand what was already in the field."
